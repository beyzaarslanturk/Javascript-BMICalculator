# Javascript-BMICalculator üßç
 <br>

#### This is one of the first projects I've done with Javascript. In the project, after the user enters his height and weight, he presses the "calculate" button and the body mass index is calculated. This project was completed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript and my purpose in making this project was to experience basic Javascript features. <br> <br> <br>

My achievements were:
- Master layout creation
- Creating main HTML attributes
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
